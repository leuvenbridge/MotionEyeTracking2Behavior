# MotionEyeTracking2Behavior
3D transformation of raw Vicon marker and eye tracking data to rotation and translation data
input:   raw Vicon marker and eye data
output:  behavior data including
         1) horizontal head position
         2) head height
         3) translational speed
         4) azimuth head direction corrected for tilt
         5) azimuth movement direction
         6) head tilt: yaw, pitch, roll
         7) head angular velocity about: yaw, pitch, roll
         8) 3D heading vector and arena intersection
         9) egocentric boundary
         10) eye-in-head position
         11) azimuth gaze direction
         12) gaze vector and arena intersection
